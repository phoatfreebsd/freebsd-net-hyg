     * 'evtchn_upcall_pending' is written non-zero by Xen to indicate
     * a pending notification for a particular VCPU. It is then cleared
     * by the guest OS /before/ checking for pending work, thus avoiding
     * a set-and-check race. Note that the mask is only accessed by Xen
     * on the CPU that is currently hosting the VCPU. This means that the
     * pending and mask flags can be updated by the guest without special
     * synchronisation (i.e., no need for the x86 LOCK prefix).
     * This may seem suboptimal because if the pending flag is set by
     * a different CPU then an IPI may be scheduled even when the mask
     * is set. However, note:
     *  1. The task of 'interrupt holdoff' is covered by the per-event-
     *     channel mask bits. A 'noisy' event that is continually being
     *     triggered can be masked at source at this very precise
     *     granularity.
     *  2. The main purpose of the per-VCPU mask is therefore to restrict
     *     reentrant execution: whether for concurrency control, or to
     *     prevent unbounded stack usage. Whatever the purpose, we expect
     *     that the mask will be asserted only for short periods at a time,
     *     and so the likelihood of a 'spurious' IPI is suitably small.
     * The mask is read before making an event upcall to the guest: a
     * non-zero mask therefore guarantees that the VCPU will not receive
     * an upcall activation. The mask is cleared when the VCPU requests
     * to block: this avoids wakeup-waiting races.

     * A domain can create "event channels" on which it can send and receive
     * asynchronous event notifications. There are three classes of event that
     * are delivered by this mechanism:
     *  1. Bi-directional inter- and intra-domain connections. Domains must
     *     arrange out-of-band to set up a connection (usually by allocating
     *     an unbound 'listener' port and avertising that via a storage service
     *     such as xenstore).
     *  2. Physical interrupts. A domain with suitable hardware-access
     *     privileges can bind an event-channel port to a physical interrupt
     *     source.
     *  3. Virtual interrupts ('events'). A domain can bind an event-channel
     *     port to a virtual interrupt source, such as the virtual-timer
     *     device or the emergency console.
     *
     * Event channels are addressed by a "port index". Each channel is
     * associated with two bits of information:
     *  1. PENDING -- notifies the domain that there is a pending notification
     *     to be processed. This bit is cleared by the guest.
     *  2. MASK -- if this bit is clear then a 0->1 transition of PENDING
     *     will cause an asynchronous upcall to be scheduled. This bit is only
     *     updated by the guest. It is read-only within Xen. If a channel
     *     becomes pending while the channel is masked then the 'edge' is lost
     *     (i.e., when the channel is unmasked, the guest must manually handle
     *     pending notifications as no upcall will be scheduled by Xen).
     *
     * To expedite scanning of pending notifications, any 0->1 pending
     * transition on an unmasked channel causes a corresponding bit in a
     * per-vcpu selector word to be set. Each bit in the selector covers a
     * 'C long' in the PENDING bitfield array.
